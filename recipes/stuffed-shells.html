  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Stuffed shells are one of my all-time favorite dinner recipes. Jumbo pasta shells are stuffed with a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, ground beef, and spinach; making this an easy and delicious dinner recipe.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 lbs of ground beef</li>
    <li>salt and pepper, to tast</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tbsp chopped onion</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp oregano</li>
    <li>2 14-oz cans tomato sauce</li>
    <li>18-piece box of jumbo pasta shells</li>
    <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1 16-oz container of whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 16-oz package of shredded mozzarella</li>
    <li>1 8-oz package of chopped spinach</li>
    <li>1-4 cup of basil</li>
    <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; add 1/2 of the ground beef with a big pinch of salt and pepper and cook until the beef is seared and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and cook the remainder. Set all meat aside.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat to medium-low and add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the onion. Saute until aromatic, about 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and oregano, followed by the ground beef and one jar of sauce. Stir to combine and reduce to a simmer. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shells and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Strain; feel free to reserve some pasta water to add to the sauce if you like.</li>
    <li>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in another pan over medium heat and add the garlic. Saute until lightly golden. Transfer garlic to a mixing bowl with ricotta, mozzarella, spinach, basil, and lemon zest and juice. Add salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Pour remaining tomato sauce into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon the cheese mixture into the shells followed by the meat mixture. As you finish stuffing each shell, place it in the sauce. Top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the shells are hot in the center and the mozzarella cheese is melted and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
